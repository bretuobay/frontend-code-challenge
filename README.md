# Front-End Interview Test

This is a react/redux solution to McMakler's front end interview:

## Reasons for choice of react/redux solution
1. Whilst it is an overkill to for a single API call, it seems React/Redux is the preferred framework for McMakler as their  public component repos show.
2. Allows me to practise React/Redux  work flow.
3. Choose classic css to reduce set up and config time.

## Main Challenge encountered

The main challenges encoutered were:
* Working around CORS with webpack dev server.
* Understanding what picture to use. In the end I chose to simply go with the first image(Maybe a carousel in a  real app?)
* Understanding what various sections from the design were meant for( I thought Mieten and Kaufen were cities :) )
